# Logging to the Elastic Stack from NLog

This repository is a MVP for getting structured logging working between NLog and the Elastic stack. It is the demo source code for the blog post published here: https://honeycomb.io/blog/2018/01/simple-structured-logging-with-nlog/

## Thanks

Thanks to Nick Lang (@fxdgear) for updating the docker images to the official open source images published by Elastic.
